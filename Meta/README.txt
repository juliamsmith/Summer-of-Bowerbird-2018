# NOTES
# This runs simulations of a single set of conditions.  For the bigger picture (multiple sets of conditions), see "Julias_ideas" file.  I haven't incorporated the midway-job-specific code, although I have tried to put the R code you sent in Python (see "Batch_func").  Didn't know exactly where to work it in, though.

# To run in Linux/OSX

# I got an error regarding importing numpy both on midway and my cpu (as if it were interpreting import numpy as a terminal command or something -- because of course I can import numpy in python just fine).  Rachel's cpu ran it fine earlier, and I don't remember making changes to the code that might lead to this issue.  I did just re-install Cygwin so that might have something to do with it.
